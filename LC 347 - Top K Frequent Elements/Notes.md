## üéØ Goal  
To find the **top K most frequent elements** in an array.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Strategy  
- Use a **min-heap** (`PriorityQueue` with ascending order) to efficiently track the **K most frequent elements**.  
- Keep adding elements (based on frequency) into the heap.  
- If the heap size exceeds `k`, remove the **least frequent** element.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity:  
**O(n log k)**  
- `O(n)` to build frequency map  
- `O(n log k)` to maintain a heap of size `k`  
- `O(k)` to build result ‚Üí overall: **O(n log k)**

### Space Complexity:  
**O(n)**  
- `O(n)` for frequency map  
- `O(k)` for heap and result ‚Üí total: **O(n)**

## üîç Why Ascending Order?

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> map.get(a) - map.get(b));

- This comparator ensures the element with the lowest frequency is at the top of the heap.
- That makes it easy to remove the least useful (least frequent) element when the heap becomes too large.
